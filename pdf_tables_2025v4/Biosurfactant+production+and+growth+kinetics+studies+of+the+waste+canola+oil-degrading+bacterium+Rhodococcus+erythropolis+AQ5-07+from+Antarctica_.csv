crystal violet,Rhodococcus pyridinivorans,0.6 mM,10% (v/v),agitated mode (160 rpm),30°C,24 h,unadjusted,73 ± 3%,whole fungi,Compared to static mode (43 ± 2%)
crystal violet,Rhodococcus pyridinivorans,0.6 mM,10% (v/v),agitated mode (160 rpm),45°C,24 h,7,91 ± 2%,whole fungi,Optimization reduced incubation time to achieve nearly complete decolorization by 67%
crystal violet,Rhodococcus pyridinivorans,0.6 mM,4% (v/v),agitated mode (160 rpm),30°C,12 h,7,59 ± 1%,whole fungi,Increased inoculum concentration leads to decreased decolorization.
crystal violet,Rhodococcus pyridinivorans,0.6 mM,12% (v/v),agitated mode (160 rpm),45°C,8 h,7,91 ± 2%,whole fungi,Highest decolorization efficiency observed.
crystal violet,Rhodococcus pyridinivorans,0.6 mM,10% (v/v),repeated cycling,30°C,12 h,unadjusted,94 ± 1% after first cycle,whole fungi,Recieved repeat addition up to 4 cycles.
crystal violet,Rhodococcus pyridinivorans,0.3 mM,10% (v/v),agitated mode (160 rpm),45°C,12 h,unadjusted,94 ± 1%,whole fungi,Higher removal observed at lower dye concentrations.
