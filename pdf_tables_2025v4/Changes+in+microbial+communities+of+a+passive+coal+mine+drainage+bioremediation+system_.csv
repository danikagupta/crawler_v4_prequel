,,,,,,,6.5-8.3,,,Sediment samples were collected from 5 ponds and wetlands at a passive coal mine drainage bioremediation site.
,,,,,<20 °C,varied by sampling years,,,,"Environmental data like temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and conductivity were collected from previous surveys for the sites."
,,,,,10-18 °C,varied by sampling years,,,,Temperatures during data collection varied; differences related to years of sampling.
,"Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia",,,,,,,,,Microbial communities varied across the five ponds with different organisms represented.
,"Anaeromyxobacter, Desulfobacterium, Desulfobulbus",,,,,,,,,These genera were among the common organisms found in anaerobic conditions.
,"Solitalea, Pedosphaera, Rhodocyclus, Alkaliflexus, Chitinophaga",,,,,,,,,These genera were significantly represented in Pond 1.
,"Ignavibacterium, Pelotomaculum",,,,,,,,,Notable fold change between wetlands and Pond 1.
